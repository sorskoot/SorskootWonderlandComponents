"postinstall": "npm run ./scripts/package-shaders.js",


And then in your ./scripts/package-shaders.js, you would have something like (pseudocode):

import {writeFile} from 'fs';
import {resolve, filename} from 'path';

const outputFolder = ...;
const shadersList = readShaders();

for (const file of shadersList) {
    writeFile(resolve(outputFolder, filename(file.path)), file.content);  
}
